Usage: 

dcm2dir $ARGV[0] $ARGV[1] $ARGV[2] $ARGV[3] $ARGV[4] $ARGV[5]

$DATE_TIME = $ARGV[0]
$user = $ARGV[1]
$proj = $ARGV[2]
$number = $ARGV[3]
$FLAG = $ARGV[4]
$FLAG2 = $ARGV[5] (Optional)

Flags: d=dicom(default), a=afni, n=nifti, s=4D files for SPM5/SPM8, t=SPM2

-------
Notes:

It looks like dcm2dir copies from

/nfs/secrets/dicom/$DATE_TIME/ 

to 

/nfs/secrets/3Tusers/$user/$proj/$number

It is assumed that final directory has inherited group permissions formatted as: "$user_$proj".  This has been default for system admin.  Otherwise, permissions may not be set appropriately.
