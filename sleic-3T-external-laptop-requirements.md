## Laptop Setup
- External video output
	- DVI (Preferred)
	- HDMI
	- VGA (Via VGA-to-DVI converter box).  The converter box has settings to adjust "Scale", or aspect ratio, which you will need to fit to your laptop's aspect ratio.
	- 1024x768 @ 60 Hz is standard output.  However, you may need to retain a 16:9 aspect ratio to prevent unexpected stretching depending on your software application (i.e. Psychtoolbox).  Schedule development time to make sure participants can see stimuli appropriately.
- Wireless network adapter disabled
- Wired network adapter set to use DHCP to obtain IP address
	-  DNS explicitly set to home IT department’s DNS servers (if necessary)
- Connected to wired network connection in 3T control room labeled ‘Guest Laptops’
- All necessary software/licenses installed by home IT department

## SLEIC IT Setup
- Static IP address assigned via MAC address lock
- Provide static IP address to home IT department
- SLEIC EPrime license server (eprime.imaging.psu.edu) running to provide EPrime functionality

## Home IT Setup
- Firewall exception created for static IP address
- License server exception created for static IP address
- Provide home department’s DNS servers (if necessary)
