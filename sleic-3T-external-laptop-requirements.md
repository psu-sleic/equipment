## Laptop Setup
- External video output
	- DVI (Preferred)
	- HDMI
	- VGA (Via VGA-to-DVI adapter)
	- 1024x768 @ 60 Hz is standard output.  However, you may need to retain a 16:9 aspect ratio to prevent unexpected stretching.  Schedule development time to make sure participants can see stimuli appropriately.

- Wired network adapter set to use DHCP to obtain IP address
	-  DNS explicitly set to home IT department’s DNS servers (if necessary)
- Connected to wired network connection in 3T control room labeled ‘Guest Laptops’

## SLEIC IT Setup

## Home IT Setup
- Firewall exception created for static IP address
