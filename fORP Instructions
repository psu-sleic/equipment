Please note:
These instructions are ONLY for the new fORP interface and 8 button box handhelds.  Delivered on 1/14/2014.

Instructions for connecting and starting up:

1) Make sure 8-button box handheld devices are plugged in.  This must occur before the power supply is connected.
2) Plug in the power supply.
3) Plug in the mini USB to the USB Hub.  Note: The serial out to USB was not readily working.
4a) The screen should say:

USB
HHSC-2x4-C
HID KEY NO 5

I have already configured these settings.  "HHSC-2x4-C" is the name of the 8 button handhelds.  Joystick will be different.  "HID KEY NO 5"  is the key configuration replicating that of the old fORP device, such that the Left box outputs 1-4 and the Right outputs 6-9.

4b) If you need to configure these settings again follow the next set of instructions.

Instructions for configuring fORP interface:

1) Click the dial knob.
2) The next screen says "Change Modes".  Scroll to "Yes" and click knob.
3) Scroll to "AutoConfigure" and click knob.
4) Scroll down to "HID KEY NO 5" and click knob.
