Prepare:

External Trigger Box
1. Banana plug (BNC cable) goes in MRI input that is closest to the control room.
2. Plug the other end of the BNC cable into the top right connector in the wall filter panel through to the control room.
3. On the other side of the wall, attach the external trigger box to the BNC T-connection (splitter).
4. Check that the USB plug for power to the external trigger is plugged into the back of the Siemens computer.
5. Check that the plug in (Fiber Optic) cable from TR Sync Pulse Repeater to external trigger box and the switch is "On".

FMenu

1. On the MRI console computer, open the Start menu, and select Run
2. Type "cmd" and hit <Enter>
3. Type "telnet mcpu" and <Enter>
4. In the prompt, type "fMenu" and <Enter>
5. Type "4" for "PMU"
6. Type "3" for "Signal Logging" and leave this screen alone until scan.

Physiological Monitoring
1. Take both physio units off the charger station.  One will be used for respiratory belt (needs to be attached) and the other will be used for the pulse oximeter.
2. During initial preparation, place the respiratory belt along the participant's diaphragm.  Check the monitored signal in the control room to make sure the signal is not too saturated.
3. Place the pulse oximeter on the participant's left middle finger and place the box somewhere so it will not easily be disturbed.  Check the monitored signal in the control room.


Scan Procedure:
1. FMenu: Right before scan starts, enter "9" to start all physiological signal recording.
2. A prompt will ask what the file name should be labelled as.
3. Start scan 
4. FMenu: Right when scan ends, enter "10" to end all physiological signal recording.


After scan:
1. Physio files are exported to C:\MedCom\log\
